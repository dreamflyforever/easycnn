### EasyCNN

This project aims to build a simple convolutional neural network optimized for limited CPU resources.

### Features

EasyCNN has a 3-layer deep convolutional structure, one pooling layer, and a sigmoid output for binary  
classification. The project includes two main parts: Forward Propagation and Backward Propagation.

### Training

To train the model, use the following command:

easycnn -t picture_folder

### Inference

To run inference on a single image, use:

easycnn -i picture
